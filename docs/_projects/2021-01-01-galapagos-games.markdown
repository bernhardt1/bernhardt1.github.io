As the founder and lead developer of Galapagos Games, I have been responsible for the conception, design, and development of our mobile game titles. Utilizing my extensive knowledge of game development and programming languages with Unity and C#, I have been able to successfully launch two mobile games on the App Store & Google Play, one in partnership with SHD Games, and the other independently.

My focus on creating engaging and intricate games has resulted in a strong and growing user base for those titles, with an average rating of 4.5/5 stars. I am constantly seeking new and innovative ways to improve my development process and stay current with industry trends. I am excited to continue growing my company and creating entertaining and immersive mobile games for players around the world.
